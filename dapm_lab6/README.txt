In this lab we learned how to share data between two activities (by using shared preferences or directly with the indent)

Problems and challenges encountered: 
Ex 1: I've tried very hard to remove the background of the android button (to have only the android icon, without the green background) but I didn't succeed. I've worked with "Image asset configurator"
Ex 3 + ex 4: I absolutely forgot about the manifest file and that I need to change it in order to see the second activity 
Ex 5: Everything would've worked just fine if I saw the exercise before "run the app".  At first, I didn't understand why the app isn't doing anything on save? why the text isn't passing to the second activity. After it I realised that I needed to have the shared preferences in the second activity too (obviously). After I solved the problem, I saw the 5th exercise  
Ex 6: When changing the background of the second activity I realised that I lost the status bar and I had to put it back
