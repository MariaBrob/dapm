This ionic tutorial followes the basic way to use a device camera to take photos and temporally save them (per session) in a photo gallery. 

I had no probles in doing it, until I tried to deploy it on a ios device. I hav a lot of problems with the versions of cocapods, cordova and the ios-deploy. After resolving them I was able to put the app on the iphone but i could't grant the necessary permisiions to open the app. I also put the ionic app on both android and ios emulators. The andoid one worked with no probles while on the ios emulator i could't open the camera as it is a feature not disponible yet.

The pictures are in  "dapm_lab10_screenshots" folder.
